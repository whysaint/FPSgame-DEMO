🔫 FPS Demo — Unity (First-Person Prototype)

A simple first-person shooter demo project built in Unity to showcase my gameplay programming, UI work, and basic AI logic.
This is not a full game — it’s a learning project to demonstrate my understanding of core Unity systems.

🎮 Features I Implemented
Player & Gameplay

First-person movement (CharacterController)

Camera look system (mouse look)

Raycast-based shooting (hit-scan logic)

Crosshair + hit effects

Player HP system + receiving damage

Kill counter displayed in UI

Enemy AI

Simple patrol movement

Raycast-based player detection

Fireball projectile attacks

Enemy death reaction + respawn system

Scene controller manages enemy waves

UI (Main Focus)

Settings popup (opens with gear icon)

Adjustable player speed (Slider → affects FPSInput)

Name input field (saving & showing player name)

Close/open animations for UI panels

Clean separation between UI and gameplay using event messages

🧠 Systems & Code Highlights

Event-based communication via a simple Messenger system

Decoupled components (player, AI, UI all work independently)
